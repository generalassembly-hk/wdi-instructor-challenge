Benefits of this framework:
- Data Model really help to have the code looking much cleaner and more intuitive
- Lot of plugins helping to not have to reinvent the wheel
- THe MVC framework really help to separate the logic

Challenges students would face learning the library:
- When learning it is better to start from zero. By learning a framework like AngularJS, students will not understand all concepts behind, and would use the framework just by duplicating existing functions, without using  
- If we start from scratch, it adds lot of new concepts (MVC, libraries to know...) It may be difficult to understand if the student does not have the basics.
